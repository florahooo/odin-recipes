        <li>1 stalk scallions</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced ginger</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon Shaoxing rice wine</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>150 g Chinese chives</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <h4>Make the dough</h4>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, add water to flour gradually. Mix with chopsticks/spatula until no more loose flour can be seen. Combine and knead into a dough.</li>
        <li>Leave to rest (covered) for 10 minutes then knead again until smooth.</li>
        <li>Cover and rest the dough again for 30-60 minutes until it becomes soft (Chinese cooks would say “as soft as an earlobe”).</li>
        <li>If using a machine: You can also use a stand mixer with a dough hook to make the dough. Knead on low speed for 8 minutes or so until smooth. Cover and rest for 30-60 minutes.</li>
        
        
        <h4>Mix the filling</h4>
        <li>While waiting for the dough to rest, mix the filling of your choice following instructions found in its respective recipe.</li>

        <h4>Roll the wrappers</h4>
        <li>Divide the dough into three parts. Roll one part into a rope then cut into 10 equal sections (cover the rest to avoid drying out).</li>
        <li>Press each piece into a small disc with the palm of your hand.</li>
        <li>Use a rolling pin to flatten it into a thin disc (Please refer to the tutorial video below). Dust with flour if it sticks. Repeat to finished the rest of the dough.</li>

        <h4>Assemble the dumplings</h4>
        <li>Place a spoonful of filling on the wrapper. Seal the wrapper using the techniqe you're most comfortable with. Please refer to the tutorial video below or the methods demonstrated in "Ten Ways to Fold Dumplings".</li>

        <h4>Boil</h4>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a full boil over a high heat. Gently slide in the dumplings (cook in two batches if using a small pot). Push them around with the back of a spoon to avoid sticking. Cover with a lid.</li>
        <li>When the water comes back to a full boil, add about 120 ml/0.5 cup of cold water then cover.</li>
        <li>Repeat the procedure another two times. When fully cooked, the dumplings should be plump and floating on the surface.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dumplings to a colander. Briefly rinse under tap water (make sure it’s drinkable water). Drain and serve immediately.</li>
